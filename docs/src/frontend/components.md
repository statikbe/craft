# Frontend components

These docs describe the JavaScript framework used in this Craft Base Install. All components are custom, self‑written and maintained, and implemented in TypeScript.

Browse all components using the sidebar. If you're a colleague and have questions, contact Karel‑Jan. If you like this setup or have suggestions, please open an issue on GitHub: [open an issue](https://github.com/statikbe/craft/issues)
