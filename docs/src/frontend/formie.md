# Formie

This component is activated when there is an element on the page with a class of `.fui-form`.

This component does two things for now, both regarding the select element.

- When a select is detected, an extra class is added to the wrapper element so we can style the select element as a custom select.
- When a multi select is detected, the select will be changed to an [autocomplete component](/frontend/autocomplete)
