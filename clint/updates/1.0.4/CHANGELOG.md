# Update 1.0.4

**Release date:** 2026-01-14

## Summary

Added `data-no-clear` attribute to the Filter component to protect specific form elements from being cleared.

## Highlights

- ✅ **Protected Fields** - Form elements with `data-no-clear` attribute persist when clear buttons are clicked
- ✅ **Flexible Control** - Apply to any form element (inputs, selects, textareas, hidden fields)
- ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing filters without the attribute work exactly as before
