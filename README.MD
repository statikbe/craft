# Craft CMS starter package by Statik.be

This a scaffolding package for Craft CMS, by [Statik.be](https://www.statik.be). We use this internally to start new projects.

### Assumptions made

We assume a couple of things

- We use [Ddev](https://ddev.com/) as our local development environment.

- We use [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for email delivery.

- We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for our frontend build.

---

### üõ† Usage

Before beginning make sure you have [Ddev](https://ddev.com/) installed and your docker-engine is running. Otherwise the install process will fail on initialization.

Use the following command to set up a new project:

```bash

composer create-project statikbe/craft PATH

```

‚û°Ô∏è A Craft CMS project will be created. Next Craft asks to start the set-up:

```bash
   ______ .______          ___       _______ .___________.
  /      ||   _  \        /   \     |   ____||           |
 |  ,----'|  |_)  |      /  ^  \    |  |__   `---|  |----`
 |  |     |      /      /  /_\  \   |   __|      |  |
 |  `----.|  |\  \----./  _____  \  |  |         |  |
  \______|| _| `._____/__/     \__\ |__|         |__|

              /      ||   \/   |     /       |
             |  ,----'|  \  /  |    |   (----`
             |  |     |  |\/|  |     \   \
             |  `----.|  |  |  | .----)   |
              \______||__|  |__| |_______/

### üé® Frontend Setup

We use tailwindscss and vite.js

- `vite.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`

Getting started

```bash

[optional] nvm install
yarn install

```

Afterwards you can build using

```bash

yarn dev

```

or

```bash

yarn watch

```

**CSS and Javascript**

`frontend/css` and `frontend/js`

**Favicon**
Add an svg in `frontend/img/` called `favicon.svg` and run

```bash

yarn favicon

```

**Icons**
Icon go in the folder `frontend/icons`

---

### üß™ Testing

There are two tests added to the frontend stack.
An A11y tester that uses pa11y-ci under the hood.
And a html tester that we wrote ourself, inspired by the pa11y code, that uses html-validate under the hood.
You can call them by using these commands:

```
$ yarn test-a11y
$ yarn test-html
```

They both use the BASE_URL variable from the .env file to get the craft sitemap. This sitemap gets parsed to get a list of all url's in the site. And the tests are then performed on these URL's.

**Attention**
To get the tester running on your local system. Run the following command in your terminal

```
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem"
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development

To work on this repo you can clone it like you would a regular project:

```

git clone git@github.com:statikbe/craft.git craft

```
